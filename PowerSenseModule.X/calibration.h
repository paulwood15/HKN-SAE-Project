  @Summary
    This function calibrates data based on calibration data points

  @Description
    This function linearly offsets data based off of calibration data points. The
    outputted data is the (raw data) + offset. A linear line is created between two
    calibration offset points and the offset is interpolated based on the inputted data.

    offset

  @Summary
    Runs calibration routine for passed calibration points array.

  @Description
    Runs calibration setup routine and makes sure that the actual and ideal points are
    within a certain tolerance to make sure that random points aren't used.
 
  @Params
    cal_point_t* cal_data_points: calibration data points array to be filled
    uint16_t num_points: number of data points
    uint16_t tolerance: tolerance for calibration setup
 
  @Returns
