Board changes TODO 01/10/2020
----------------------------------------------------
- [x]  Verify connector fitting
- [x]  shorten PCB at connector. The connector has a seal and screw holes to mount to an enclosure
- [x]  re-route CAN differential tracks to connector
- [x]  search different shunt jumper
- [x]  search for cheaper cheaper 47 uF cap
- [x]  search for cheaper cheaper 6.8 uF cap. Replaced with 2 4.7 uF
- [x]  verify cap footprints around buck
- [x]  rewire programming jumper or remove it. Removed it.
- [x]  op amp package
- [x]  label header functions
- [x]  footprint for the crystal needs indication of pin 1 and orientation
- [x]  Choose protection diode
- [x]  silk screen text for config resistors
- [x]  Protection diodes for MCU ADC inputs? No. Voltage divider for voltage sensing for range 0-20V and max voltage for buck is 17V so have protection diode for 15-17V only across input power to the device
- [x]  Clean up board layout
- [x]  SSOP CAN transceiver ? None
- TVS zener diodes: https://www.diodes.com/assets/App-Note-Files/TVS-in-Automotive-Applications.pdf
- [ ]  Update BOM
- [ ]  Review layout
- [ ]  Review routing
- [ ]  Review BOM
